# ask-ai-about-your-data
An educational end-to-end project that demonstrates how to build a conversational data analysis tool. Users can upload a CSV file and ask questions about it in natural language. The backend, powered by FastAPI and Ollama, uses an LLM to dynamically generate, execute, and interpret Python Pandas code to provide answers. Containerized using Docker.
